You will need to be in a browser tab pointing to Namebase to use those scripts :
- Base scripts must be run in the "Developer Tools"
- Bookmark versions need to be used as bookmark URLs (also known as bookmarklet)

Available scripts :
- [list all owned TLD](./list-tlds.js) (bookmark version [here](./list-tlds-fav.js))
- [list many TLDs on the marketplace](./bulk-market-listing.js)
- [create X new HNS addresses](./create-HNS-addresses.js) (bookmark version [here](./create-HNS-addresses-fav.js))
- [remove the "new offer pending" for every names](./view-all-offers.js) (bookmark version [here](./view-all-offers-fav.js))
